# dndspell
Mobile site for 5th edition spell lookup. That way, you don't have to flip through your Player's Handbook. :)

Thanks to [tadzik](https://github.com/tadzik) for providing the spell JSON file I used. It can be [in this repo](https://github.com/tadzik/5e-spells).

I have this hosted [on Heroku](https://spells5thed.herokuapp.com/).
